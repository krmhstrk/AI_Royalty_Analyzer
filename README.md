# üéµ AI-Powered Royalty Analyzer

## üéØ Project Purpose

This project demonstrates an AI-driven system designed to automate and streamline critical processes within music royalty management. The core objectives include:

1.  **Automated Data Extraction:** Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically extract key information from complex licensing agreements (e.g., royalty rates, payment terms, territorial rights, minimum guarantees).
2.  **Discrepancy Identification:** Implementing mechanisms to help identify potential inconsistencies or anomalies within royalty reports by comparing reported data against contractual terms or historical patterns.
3.  **Revenue Forecasting & Trend Analysis:** Structuring extracted and reported data to facilitate the analysis of revenue trends and enable more accurate financial forecasting.
4.  **Automated Reporting:** Generating summarized insights and visualizations through a simple dashboard to support data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Demonstrated (Conceptual)

This project conceptually utilizes the following technologies:

* **OpenAI API (e.g., GPT models):** For advanced document analysis (contract parsing) and natural language understanding tasks.
* **Python:** As the primary programming language for scripting, API interactions, and data manipulation.
* **Google Colab:** As the development environment for Python-based data extraction scripts.
* **Pandas:** For structuring and analyzing data within Python.
* **Streamlit:** For building a simple, interactive web dashboard for data visualization and insights.
* **(Conceptual) Google Sheets / Databases:** As a potential backend for storing structured contract data and royalty reports, enabling further analysis and calculations.
